Classnote 2018.2.27
-Class: A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type support.
A class specifies the data and methods that constitute each object.  For each of the following classes, describe what the attributes or data might be and also what methods or behaviors you think are appropriate
-Object: Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behaviors â€“ wagging the tail, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.
-Attribute: An attribute is another term for a field. It's typically a public constant or a public variable that can be accessed directly. In this particular case, the array in Java is actually an object and you are accessing the public constant value that represents the length of the array.
-Behavior: The Behavior leaf node provides a framework for adding user-defined actions into the scene graph. Behavior is an abstract class that defines two methods that must be overridden by a subclass: An initialization method, called once when the behavior becomes "live," and a processStimulus method called whenever appropriate by the Java 3D behavior scheduler. The Behavior node also contains an enable flag, a scheduling region, a scheduling interval, and a wakeup condition.
-Encapsulation: is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts. The other three are inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. Therefore, it is also known as data hiding.
- Constructor: Special methods that are called when an object is instantiated. In other words, when you use the new keyword. The constructor initializes the newly created object. 
-Invoke: To call a method.
-Getter methods: Getter and setter are two conventional methods that are used for retrieving and updating value of a variable
-Setter methods: Getter and setter are two conventional methods that are used for retrieving and updating value of a variable.
